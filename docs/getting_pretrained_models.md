# Pre-trained models

[BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu) aims to provide a variety of high quality pre-trained models.
Note that unlike Caffe itself, these models usually have licenses **academic research / non-commercial use only**.

## TODO

Write something about the model zoo.

## Auxiliary Data

Additionally, you will probably eventually need some auxiliary data (mean image, synset list, etc.): run `data/ilsvrc12/get_ilsvrc_aux.sh` from the root directory to obtain it.
